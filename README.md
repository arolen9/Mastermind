# Mastermind
This is basic working algorithm for the game of Mastermind. It is written in JavaScript with working but, by no means, pretty HTML front end. This code will serve as the basis for the much more sophisticated GUI which I am building with HTML5, CSS3,  Adobe Photoshop CS6 and JavaScript.

To play the primitive interface, just come up with a 4 digit code. The code can contain digits from 1 to 6 with possible repetitions. To give a few examples, some valid code combinatios to test against the algorithm include:

6,4,5,3

1,6,5,3

5,5,5,6

2,2,3,4

2,2,2,2

1,5,3,4

5,4,2,3

4,2,5,5

5,3,3,3

3,4,1,1

2,5,6,3

3,6,5,4


Once you have a combination code in mind, or written down somewhere, press the SUBMIT button and interact by providing hints about # of digits correct (colors) and # of digits that are in correct positions in the code (positions).

Your code will be guessed within 10 tries. 

Enjoy!
